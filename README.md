# About
This project originaly started here: https://github.com/reischle/fritzmeter
The project was changed to be working with an Arduino Yun and the Wifi connection.
Also the collection of the data from the fritzbox was changed.
The motor control was removed in order to work with the analog outputs for the analog gauges used as hardware displays.

## Hardware
- Arduino Yun 
- 2 x Analog Gauges 0 - 5V
- 

## Functionality
The Arduino requests the information of the used data for up and down load rate at the router. (Need to be an AVM Fr!tzBox)
After transforming the data the two gauges will be set with the analog values
